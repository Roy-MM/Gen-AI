Bedtime Lullaby Story Generator - Code Explanation

1.  Importing the Model The code imports the Model class from the
    byllm.llm package, which is used to connect with a language model
    (in this case, Gemini).

2.  Setting up the Gemini Model The variable llm is initialized with the
    Gemini 1.5 Flash model. This model will be used to generate lullaby
    stories.

3.  Creating a Lullaby Function The function
    create_lullaby(keyword: str) is defined to generate a lullaby story
    based on a keyword. It uses the language model (llm) to produce the
    output.

4.  Walker: LullabyGame

    -   LullabyGame is a walker (a kind of agent in Jac language) that
        manages the process of generating a lullaby.
    -   It has one property: keyword, which is the word used to inspire
        the lullaby.
    -   It has two actions:
        -   start: begins the process by creating a lullaby node.
        -   tell_story: generates and prints the lullaby story.

5.  Node: lullaby

    -   Represents a container for the generated story.
    -   Has one property: story (initialized as an empty string).

6.  Implementations

    -   LullabyGame.start: Creates a lullaby node and visits it.
    -   LullabyGame.tell_story: Calls create_lullaby with the keyword,
        stores the result in story, and prints it.

7.  Entry Point (Main Program)

    -   When the script is run directly, it asks the user to enter a
        keyword.
    -   The program then spawns a LullabyGame with the given keyword,
        which triggers the lullaby generation.

Summary: This program takes a word from the user and uses the Gemini
language model to create a lullaby story based on that word. It
structures the process using Jac concepts: walkers (LullabyGame), nodes
(lullaby), and implementations (start, tell_story).
